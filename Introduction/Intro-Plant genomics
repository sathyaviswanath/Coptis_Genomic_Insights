# **What is Genome?**
- A genome is the complete set of genetic material present in an organism, including all of its genes and non-coding sequences of DNA. 
# **What is Genomics? (A study of genomes)**
- It refers to the computer aided study of structure and function of entire genome (entire genetic compliment) of a living organism.
- It deals with mapping of genes on the chromosomes and sequencing of genes in an organism. 
- It is a rapid and accurate method of gene mapping more than the recombination mapping and deletion mapping techniques. 
- The genomic techniques are highly powerful, efficient and effective in solving complex genetic problems. 
- Now the use of genomic techniques has become indispensable in plant breeding and genetics.
# **Origin of Terminology**
- The term genomics was first used by Thomas Roderick in 1986 for “mapping, sequencing and characterizing genomes”.
- Later the term genome was introduced in 1920 by the German botanist Hans Winkler (1877–1945) to describe “the haploid chromosome set, which, together with the pertinent protoplasm, specifies the material foundations of the species”.
- Most crop plant genomes have billions of nucleotide bases - Arabidopsis thaliana has 120 million bases that encode approximately 25,000 genes.
- The entire Arabidopsis genome was sequenced in 2000.
# **What is Plant Genome**
- A plant genome is the complete set of DNA and genes in a plant, organized into chromosomes and containing the genetic instructions for that plant's life.
- Plant genomes are more complex than other eukaryotic genomes, and analysis reveals many evolutionary flips and turns of the DNA sequences over time .
- Plants show widely different chromosome numbers and varied ploidy levels. Overall, the size of plant genomes (both number of chromosomes and total nucleotide base- pairs) exhibits the greatest variation of any kingdom in the biological world. 
- For example, tulips contain over 170 times as much DNA as the small weed Arabidopsis thaliana. 
- The DNA of plants, like animals, can also contain regions of sequence repeats, sequence inversions, or transposable element insertions, which further modify their genetic content.
- Traditionally, variation in chromosome inversions and ploidy has been used to build up a picture of how plant species have evolved.
